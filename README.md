# AI & Data Science Project Portfolio

A personal collection of small practical machine learning and mini fullstack AI projects.
## Projects
### 1. [Weather Full-Stack Mini AI system] (./weather_full_stack_mini/)
A complete en-to-end pipeline that:
- Fetches real-time weather data from Open-Meteo
- Stores it in SQLite database
- Trains a tempersture classifier ('Cold', 'Mild', 'Hot')
- Serves predictions via Flask API
- Logs predictions daily via a Python-based scheduler

### 2. [Unsupervised Learning - K-means Clustering with Sci-Kit Learn] (./unsupervised_learning/)
A K-means clustering of red wine database from VIVINO

### 3. [Supervised Learning] (./supervised_learning/)
A multiple linear regression of the wine database from VIVINO with sklearn
A logistic regression with StatsModels. The classification goal is to predict if the bank client will subscribe a term deposit.
Absenteeism case study - a Logistic regression with SKLearn. Prediction of excessive absenteeism in hours per day of the company personel.

### 4. [Deep Learning] (./deep_learning/)
Audiobooks case study - TensorFlow 2 model to predict if the current users of audiobooks app will make another purchase within next 6 months.
MNIST classification exercise - TensoFlow 2
