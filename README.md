# AI & Data Science Project Portfolio

A personal collection of small practical machine learning an mini fullstack AI projects I've built to demonstrate my technical skills in real-world scenarios.
## Projects
### 1. [Weather Full-Stack Mini AI system] (./weather_full_stack_mini/)
A complete en-to-end pipeline that:
- Fetches real-time weather data from Open-Meteo
- Stores it in SQLite database
- Trains a tempersture classifier ('Cold', 'Mild', 'Hot')
- Serves predictions via Flask API
- Logs predictions daily via a Python-based scheduler

[View full prject README](./weather_full_stack_mini/README.md)

### 2. [Unsupervised Learning - K-means Clustering with Sci-Kit Learn] (./unsupervised_learning/)
A K-means clustering of red wine database according to given features

### 3. [Supervised Learning with Sci-Kit Learn] (./supervised_learning/)
A multiple linear regression of the wine database from vivino
A logistic regression. The classification goal is to predict if the bank client will subscribe a term deposit.
